   <p class="copy lede">The <a href="<http://www.brownstoner.com/history/walkabout-crown-heights-consumers-park-brewery">Consumers Park Brewery</a> complex sits at 946-978 Franklin Ave. Opened in 1900 by German immigrant Herman Raub to manufacture lager beer, the Brewery sat next to a brand new railroad station (Consumers Park Station), and the Brick Hill Hotel, which included a restaurant and a beer garden concert-facility. </p>

      <p class="copy"> The first brewery in in the United States to be run purely on electric power, Consumer’s Park boosted the neighborhood’s economic status as the homes nearby acquired electricity shortly thereafter. Today, the brewery complex is shut down, and nestled between the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens and the Brooklyn Museum. </p>

      Consumers Park isn’t the only remnant of central Brooklyn’s Industrial days. On Bergen Street in between Classon and Franklin sits the old Heinz plant, which dates back to 1920. The site of the Nassau Brewing Company from 1860 to 1914, and of Monti Moving and Storage until 2001, the building <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/10/nyregion/10citywide.html"> now houses independent artists’ studios</a>. The "57 Varieties" text is still visible on the facade.</p>

      <p class="copy"> 254 Hancock Street was one of the first townhouses to be build in Bedford Stuyvesant - around 1890. These row homes were built with electricity, and were often constructed and bought on spec midway through the building process, in order to add personal details such as parquet floors, stained glass windows, and woodcarvings in mantle pieces and ornaments to mansard roofs. In the late 1800s, these homes were meant to overshadow the less ornate brownstones of Cobble Hill and Brooklyn Heights.</p>

      Jimmy's Stationery and Toys opened in 1968 and was in business for over 80 years in Bedford-Stuyvesant, until 2015. Then, a new landlord bought the building and evicted the retail tenant. In its place today is Chicky’s General Store, an upscale bodega that sells things like single eggs, artichokes, and kombucha.</p>
